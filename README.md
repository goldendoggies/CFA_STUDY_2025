Example notes


## Technologies
1. JavaScript
2. CSS
3. HTML


## Tools
1. Visual Studio Code
2. Git
3. GitHub
4. UNIX Terminal (Mac)


## Installation
Use the 'git clone' feature to pull this repository from github and install it on your local machine.
Then change directory 'cd' to the main project directory, whereever you cloned it.


Hint: In terminal, cd to the location you prefer before issuing the git clone command, such as 'repos'. 

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:goldendoggies/CFA_STUDY_2025.git
$ cd CFA_STUDY_L2
```

From terminal, open the index.html file. This should open a browser window on your default web browser and take you to a local instance of the webpage.

```bash
$ open ./index.html
```

Enjoy!
